# AppleBCM57XXEthernet

This is the **AppleBCM5701Ethernet.kext** taken from Catalina, patched to work for Big Sur and newer.
* This kext was patched and uploaded by **[Exception](https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-8#post-930901)** in Apple Life. The original thread is in Russian, but someone had made a well written explanation about it in English [here](https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-9#post-1031837) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407122311/https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-9#post-1031837)). 



#### How to use: 
1. Add your device-id in the kext's Info.plist if not included. <br>
2. Set MinKernel to **20.0.0**. <br>

#### Cosmetic
This is optional. You could also apply a **Kernel -> Patch** to show the correct model in System Report, edit accordingly to match your model.

Iâ€™m only re-uploading it here because I noticed that the longer the attachment stays in that thread, the more likely it will automatically get deleted.

# CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet
Alternatively, you could also use the [**CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet.kext**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Ethernet) provided in OCLP.

Add these to **Kernel -> Patch**:

The purpose of this kernel patch is to bypass the hardware device ID check in the binary code of the CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet kext. The AppleBCM57XXEthernet kext has also been patched in a similar manner. Both CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet and AppleBCM57XXEthernet kexts have already been patched to prevent conflicts with the native AppleBCM5701Ethernet kext in the system, but CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet was originally intended for use on real Macs, and therefore did not require patching out the device ID check. Hence, we patch it ourselves to enable its use on non-Mac systems - by, of course bypassing the device ID check.
  
* This patch is just the same as the `Broadcom BCM57785 Patch` from the sample.plist of Opencorepkg, but finds/replace the **whole** series of hex instead **without the base and hex mask**. In theory, the OC's `Broadcom BCM57785 Patch` should still be applicable to this kext as it was from Catalina anyway, however in my attempt it did not work. Opencore probably does not support masking on injected kexts.


This is optional. I've had these device properties in my config.plist since the beginning I used this kext, I tried to remove them and the kext still loaded. If that wasn't the case for you, then you may need to add them:

|Key*|Value|Type|
|-|-|-|
|compatible |pci14e4,16b4 |String |
|device-id|B4160000|Data|
|built-in|01|Data|


#### Cosmetic
This is optional. You could also apply a **Kernel -> Patch** to show the correct model in System Report, edit accordingly to match your model.

### macOS Catalina and earlier
For Catalina and older, it is possible to use either the: <Br>
1.  The easy way: [FakePCIID and FakePCIID_BCM57XX_as_BCM57765.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Fake-PCI-ID), or;
2.  Using the `Broadcom BCM57785 patch` from the sample.plist of Opencorepkg - in combination with `device-id`, and `compatible` device property injection of a native model (BCM57765):

|Key*|Value|Type|
|-|-|-|
|compatible |pci14e4,16b4 |String |
|device-id|B4160000|Data|
|built-in|01|Data|

* Both of these will load the native AppleBCM5701Ethernet.kext in the system. 
* The only reason we need to reinject the older version of the kext on newer macOS versions is because it was heavily rewritten in Big Sur, and some support was also dropped. As you can see, the OCLP had the need to reinject the kext on older Macs that had Broadcom Ethernet.
* Don't mind the naming of the patch in the sample.plist. It is named "Broadcom BCM57785 patch" perhaps because the patch was originally made by someone with a BCM57785, but it should still work with other models supported by the native kext (via spoofing).

If you use any of the following that requires device properties injection, the device-id  will show as the spoofed one (14e4,16b4/BCM577**65**) - as these methods require spoofing the ethernet into a native model to make the kext load.

If you get confuse by the naming of the kext, here's the difference:
* `AppleBCM5701Ethernet` - Native, it's in the System/Library/Extensions
* `CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet` - from OCLP
* `AppleBCM57XXEthernet` - from Apple Life
