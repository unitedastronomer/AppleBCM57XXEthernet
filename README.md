# AppleBCM57XXEthernet

This is the **AppleBCM5701Ethernet.kext** taken from Catalina, but  patched to work for Big Sur and newer. This kext was originally patched and uploaded by **[Exception](https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-8#post-930901)** in Apple Life. The original thread is in Russian, but someone had made a well written explanation about it in English [here](https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-9#post-1031837) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407122311/https://www.applelife.ru/threads/patching-applebcm5701ethernet-kext.27866/page-9#post-1031837)). 



How to use: <br>
1. Add your device-id in the kext's Info.plist if not included. <br>
2. Set MinKernel to **20.0.0**. <br>

#### Cosmetic
You could also apply a **Kernel -> Patch** to show the correct model in System Report.

Iâ€™m only re-uploading it here because I noticed that the longer the attachment stays in that thread, the more likely it will automatically get deleted.

Alternatively, you could also use the [**CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet.kext**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Ethernet) provided in OCLP repo, and then add these to **Kernel -> Patch**:

Add these to device properties:

### macOS Catalina and earlier
For Catalina and older, it is possible to use either the: <Br>
1.  The easy way: [FakePCIID and FakePCIID_BCM57XX_as_BCM57765.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Fake-PCI-ID), or;
2.  The technical way: using the `Broadcom BCM57785 patch` from the sample.plist of Opencorepkg - in combination with device-id, and compatible device property injection of a native model (BCM57765):

|Key*|Value|Type|
|-|-|-|
|compatible |pci14e4,16b4 |String |
|device-id|B4160000|Data|
|built-in|01|Data|

> Don't mind the naming of the patch in the sample.plist. It is named "Broadcom BCM57785 patch" because it was originally made for BCM57785, but it should still work with other model supported by the native kext (via spoofing).

You could also apply a **Kernel -> Patch** to show the correct model in System Report.

> If you use **CatalinaBCM5701Ethernet.kext** with/or the **Broadcom BCM57785 patch**, the device-id  will show as the spoofed one (14e4,16b4/BCM577**65**) - as these methods require spoofing the ethernet into a native model to make the kext load. With **AppleBCM57XXEthernet.kext**, it was patched to always return a supported model so it does not need any spoofing.
